## Project Overview: JavaScript Bot for Client-Side Automation

This project involves the creation of a script using JavaScript primarily for client-side automation. By injecting this code directly into the application via the console and executing it. Its main functionality revolves around simulating mouse events, thereby enabling automated interactions with the client-side elements of the application.

### Key Features:

- **Disconnect people**: Automatic continuos disconnection of the user with the specified username (customizable timing).

### Potential Use Cases:

- **Target harrasment**: Piss off your friends with this script without moving a finger.

### Considerations:

- **Rate Limit Considerations**: Due to its intensive client-side actions, there's a possibility of encountering rate limiting.

- **User Privileges** Users need to ensure proper server privileges to avoid potential disconnections from the target.

- **Compatibility**: Compatibility with different browsers and application versions should be considered to ensure optimal performance across various environments.

### Conclusion:

This project is basically a joke and nothing serious, writing this README justt for fun
